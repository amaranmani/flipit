# Introduction

FlipIt is a feature flipper for .NET.  It is a very simple tool with a limited feature set.  We simply want to provide a way to flip features based on any kind of conditions and to change those conditions over time without touching the features themselves.  Put another way we want to respect the Open/Closed principle.  We also want to fully support Inversion of Control.

Stay tuned.  More details and code samples are coming coon.
